# Progress: 2026-09-22-capture-spike

Append only. One entry at the end of every plan step. Never rewrite, reorder
or delete an entry, including the ones recording a mistake.

Entry shape:

    ## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM  Step N: <step name as the plan writes it>

    Worked: <what landed>
    Did not work: <what was tried and failed, and why. Omit only if nothing failed>
    Verification: <command and what it actually printed>
    Next: <next step>

Take the timestamp from `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'`.

<!-- append entries below this line -->

## 2026-09-22 23:21  Step 1: Plan

Worked: plan and this log, from main at 30ebe45.
Next: step 2, snippet test first.
